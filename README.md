# recommended_books

This project is the basis of a book recommendation system. Its main goal is to help users find suitable books based on selected genres, categories and other filters.

The functionality of the project includes:

    Genre and category selection form: The user can select genres (for example, fantasy, detective, novel and science fiction) and categories (for example, adventure, thriller and drama) that he is interested in.

    Additional filters: The user can expand the search by selecting additional filters, such as the age and country of the author.

    "Show Additional Filters" button: Allows you to display or hide additional filters at the user's request.

    Displaying recommendations: After filling out the form and sending a request, the system displays recommendations in the form of a list of books corresponding to the selected filters. For each book, the title, genre, category, century and country of the author are displayed.

    The ability to go back: Added a "Back" button that allows the user to return to the previous page.

The project code consists of two HTML files: "index.html " and "recommend.html ". "index.html " contains a form for selecting genres and categories, and "recommend.html " displays recommendations based on the selected parameters.

Also in the project there is a file "style.css", which contains styles for the design of pages, and a file "script.js", which contains a small JavaScript script for interacting with form elements.

This project also uses an SQLite database to store information about books. 

All these components interact with each other to create a user interface that allows the user to select preferences and receive appropriate book recommendations.

This project is an example of a simple recommendation system, and its functionality can be expanded or customized at your discretion.
